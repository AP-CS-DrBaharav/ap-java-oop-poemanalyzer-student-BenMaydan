=================
A class called PoemAnalyzer is designed as shown in the above class diagram.
Write the class following the class diagram and the below guidelines:
 - Three private instance variables: wordsArray of the type String[][] and rows and cols of type int.
- Constructors - a default constructor with no argument and assigns 0 values to rows and cols,
and a second constructor which takes two arguments for rows and cols, and allocates the appropriate
array space. 
- Write the method setRow, which given a row number and an array of Strings, fills these Strings into the
appropriate row in the wordsArray. The number of words to put in will be smaller or equal to cols.
- Write the method findLongest which returns the longest word in the poem.
- Write the mthod contains, which returns true if the input String appears in the poem.
- toString method which returns the poem printed as in the below example. Do not worry about extra blank spaces 
at an end of line, or between word to a comma or full stop.


An example to the program performance is given below.

If the below is included in your tester class:
=== start

  PoemAnalyzer p = new PoemAnalyzer(8,6);
        
        p.setRow(0,new String[] {"And","then","the","day","came",","});
        p.setRow(1,new String[] {"when", "the", "risk"});           
        p.setRow(2,new String[] {"to","remain","tight"});    
        p.setRow(3,new String[] {"in","a","bud"});    
        p.setRow(4,new String[] {"was","more","painful"}); 
        p.setRow(5,new String[] {"than","the","risk"});  
        p.setRow(6,new String[] {"it","took"});  
        p.setRow(7,new String[] {"to","blossom","."});  
        
        
        
        System.out.println("***\n\n ANAIS NIN \"RISK\" ");
        System.out.println(p + "\n\n***\n\n");
        
        System.out.println("The longest word in the poem: " + p.findLongest());
        String str = "buddy";
        System.out.println("The word " + str + " appears in the poem: " + p.contains(str));
        str = "bud";
        System.out.println("The word " + str + " appears in the poem: " + p.contains(str));

=== end

The output wold be:

=== start

***

 ANAIS NIN "RISK" 
And then the day came , 
when the risk    
to remain tight    
in a bud    
was more painful    
than the risk    
it took     
to blossom .    


***


The longest word in the poem: painful 
The word buddy appears in the poem: false
The word bud appears in the poem: true

=== end

=============== End
